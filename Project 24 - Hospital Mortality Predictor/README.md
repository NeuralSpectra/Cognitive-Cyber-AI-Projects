# **Project 24: Hospital Mortality Predictor**

This project predicts **patient mortality risk** based on clinical and demographic features such as age, vital signs, laboratory indicators, and other hospital-related parameters.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can assist healthcare analytics by identifying high-risk patients and supporting early decision-making in clinical environments.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**
   * **Scaler_y.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to input patient data and predict mortality risk interactively.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Minor changes were made to accommodate updated Python, Jupyter, and library versions. The modeling logic, evaluation strategy, and predictive performance remain fully consistent with the original implementation.**
