# **Project 23: Concrete Compressive Strength Predictor**

This project predicts the **compressive strength of concrete** based on material composition and curing-related features such as cement content, water ratio, additives, and age.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in civil and materials engineering to estimate structural strength and support data-driven construction decisions.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**
   * **Scaler_y.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to input material parameters and predict concrete strength in real time.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Minor updates were applied to align with newer Python and library versions. The core modeling approach, feature usage, and prediction accuracy remain unchanged.**
