# **Project 30: Bird Species Predictor**

**This project predicts the species of a bird from an image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).**

**It demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to image classification tasks, providing real-time predictions based on uploaded bird images.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed with an editor like VS Code or PyCharm.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Bird Classifier.keras**
   * **bird_labels.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   * **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to upload an image and see the predicted bird species interactively.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Major adjustments were made due to updates in Python, Jupyter, and library versions. The CNN architecture, data preprocessing, and classification logic remain unchanged.**
