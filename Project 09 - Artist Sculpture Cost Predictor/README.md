# Project 9: Artist Sculpture Cost Predictor

This project predicts the **cost of a sculpture** based on features such as **materials, dimensions, artist experience, and style**.

It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to regression problems using real-world data, helping to understand which factors influence the pricing of artistic creations.
