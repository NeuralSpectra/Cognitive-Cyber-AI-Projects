# Project 1: Laptop Price Predictor

### Project Description
In this project, we built a precise model to predict the price of a laptop based on useful features like RAM, hard drive, brand, GPU, and more.  

The workflow includes data loading, data visualization, and machine learning. Everything is clearly documented in the Jupyter Notebook, so anyone can follow along and learn from it.  

We applied smart techniques to make the predictions accurate and the project practical — perfect for learners who want to understand how data science can solve real-world problems.  

## How to Use the Streamlit Application
1. Make sure you have VS Code, PyCharm, or any editor with Python 3.8 installed.
2. Download or place the following files in the **Same Directory/Folder**:
   - app.py
   - Finalized-Model.pickle
   - x_scaler.pickle
   - y_scaler.pickle
3. Open the terminal in your editor and run:
**streamlit run app.py**

This will open a browser tab to interact with the GUI application.

## Note About the Notebook
**Some minor changes were made in the Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb file) (Model Building section) due to Python updates.**
**The result and functionality are completely identical to the original video.**
