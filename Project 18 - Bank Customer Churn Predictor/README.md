# **Project 18: Bank Customer Churn Predictor**

This project predicts whether a **bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank)** based on features such as **CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, and other customer attributes**.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can be used to analyze customer behavior and help financial institutions understand factors that influence customer retention.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and **predict whether a customer will churn or not**.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section to account for updates in Python, Jupyter, and library versions.
The results, logic, and model performance remain completely identical to the original analysis.**
