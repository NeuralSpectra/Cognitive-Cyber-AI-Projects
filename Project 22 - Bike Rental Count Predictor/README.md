# **Project 22: Bike Rental Count Predictor**

This project predicts the **number of bikes rented** based on environmental and temporal features such as weather conditions, seasonal information, and time-based indicators.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to demand forecasting problems, helping understand how external factors influence bike rental usage.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**
   * **Scaler_y.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and predict bike rental counts in real time.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Minor adjustments were made during model development to account for updated Python and library versions. The modeling logic, feature handling, and prediction performance remain consistent with the original analysis.**
