# Project 4: Attrition Rate Calculator

This project predicts which employees are likely to stay or leave based on factors like **marital status, promoted position, and other employee attributes**.
It is designed to help understand **employee attrition patterns** using machine learning in a practical and beginner-friendly way.

The project workflow includes **data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning**, all clearly documented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Note About the Notebook

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section due to updates in Python and Jupyter.
The results, logic, and overall functionality remain completely identical to the original video.**
