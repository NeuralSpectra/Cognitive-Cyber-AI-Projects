# Project 3: Number Sequence Predictor

In this project, I built a simple and beginner-friendly model that predicts the next number in a given sequence.
For example, if you provide a sequence like **5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30**, the model will predict the next number — such as **39.8** or **40.1**, depending on the precision of the model.

This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of sequence learning and regression in a very intuitive and easy way for beginners.

## How to Use the Streamlit Application

To run the Streamlit app:

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.
2. Use **VS Code** or **PyCharm** as your editor.
3. Download the following files and keep them in the same directory:

   * **app.py**
   * **Model-Number-Sequence.h5**
4. Open your terminal in that directory and run:

   streamlit run app.py

5. A new browser tab will open automatically where you can interact with the live app.

## Note About the Notebook

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section due to updates in Python and Jupyter.**
**The results, logic, and overall functionality remain completely identical to the original video.**
