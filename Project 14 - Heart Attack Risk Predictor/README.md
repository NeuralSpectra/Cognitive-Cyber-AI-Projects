# **Project 14: Heart Attack Risk Predictor**

This project predicts the **risk of a heart attack** for a patient based on features such as **Sex, Age, Heart Rate, Thallium Test (Thall), Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Slp)**, and other relevant health indicators.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to medical data to provide insights into patient risk, helping healthcare professionals and learners explore predictive health modeling.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system along with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

    **streamlit run app.py** 

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and assess heart attack risk live.
