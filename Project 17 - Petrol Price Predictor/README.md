# **Project 17: Petrol Price Predictor**

This is a **basic beginner-friendly project** designed to help understand how a simple machine learning model can be built using **date-based features such as Month, Day, and Year** to predict the **petrol price (USD)**.

**The project focuses on fundamentals like data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using a minimal feature set, making it ideal for beginners learning regression concepts.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and **predict petrol prices based on the selected date**.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section to account for updates in Python, Jupyter, and library versions.
The results, logic, and model behavior remain completely identical to the original implementation.**
