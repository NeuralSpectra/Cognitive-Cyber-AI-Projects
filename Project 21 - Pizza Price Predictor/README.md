# **Project 21: Pizza Price Predictor**

This project predicts the **price of a pizza** based on multiple numerical and categorical features related to size, ingredients, and other influencing factors.

**It serves as a practical example of applying machine learning to a simple real-world pricing problem, helping beginners understand data preprocessing, scaling, and regression-based prediction workflows.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**
   * **Scaler_y.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and predict pizza prices live.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Minor adjustments were made during model building to align with updated Python and library versions.The overall logic, workflow, and prediction behavior remain identical to the original implementation.**
