# **Project 8: Bank Customer Card Type Predictor**

This project predicts the **credit card category** a bank customer is most likely to have, based on features such as **Age, Income, Credit Score, Spending Score, and Customer Status**.

It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to **multi-class classification** using real-world banking data, helping to understand what factors influence customer segmentation.

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed and you have an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.
Place the following files in the **same directory**:

* **app.py**
* **Finalized-Model.pickle**

Open a terminal in that directory and run:

**streamlit run app.py**

A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the live app.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some small updates were made in the Model Building section to ensure compatibility with the latest Python and Jupyter versions. The results, model behavior, and workflow remain fully identical to the original implementation.**
