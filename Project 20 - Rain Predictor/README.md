# **Project 20: Rain Predictor**

This project predicts **whether it will rain or not** based on historical weather and atmospheric conditions such as **humidity, pressure, temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, and temporal features**.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world weather data to model rainfall patterns and support basic weather forecasting tasks.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and **predict rainfall outcomes live**.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section to account for updates in Python, Jupyter, and library versions.
The results, logic, and model performance remain completely identical to the original analysis.**
