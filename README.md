## About Me

Hi ! I’m Daanyaal — a Data Scientist and Cybersecurity professional based in U.A.E.
While my core background is in Cybersecurity, I’ve always been deeply fascinated by how AI and Data Science can amplify digital defense, automate detection, and uncover hidden insights.

During my 6-month Data Science internship at a London-based company in Dubai, I had the opportunity to work on a series of real-world, production-level projects. These projects formed the foundation for this repository — a collection of 50 advanced AI and Data Science implementations that merge the best of cybersecurity, data analytics, and artificial intelligence.

My approach has always been integration-focused — blending multiple disciplines to create solutions that are both technically advanced and practically impactful.

💡 Why This Repository Exists?

This collection is not a set of random tutorials — it’s a portfolio of hands-on, real-world projects, each built with purpose:

🌍 To share knowledge openly with learners and researchers.

⚙️ To demonstrate how AI + Data Science + Cybersecurity can work together in meaningful ways.

🧠 To inspire innovation through real implementations, not just theory.

Every project includes:

A Streamlit app for live interaction.

A video walkthrough explaining design and implementation.

Code, datasets, and documentation for reproducibility.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt.
If you find value in this work, acknowledgment is always appreciated — collaboration and contribution are at the heart of this initiative.

## ⚠️ Important

**Large files in this repository (e.g., videos, databases) cannot be downloaded directly using the GitHub “Download ZIP” option. Doing so will result in corrupted placeholder files (often just a few bytes). To download the full content correctly, you must use Git LFS:**

**1: git lfs install**

**2: git clone https://github.com/NeuralSpectra/Cognitive-Cyber-AI-Projects.git**

**3: cd Cognitive-Cyber-AI-Projects**

**4: git lfs pull**

**Following these commands will ensure all large files are downloaded correctly and are fully usable.**
