   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and **predict petrol prices live**.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section to account for updates in Python, Jupyter, and library versions.
The results, logic, and model performance remain completely identical to the original analysis.**
