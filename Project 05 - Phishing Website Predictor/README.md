# Project 5: Website Phishing Predictor

This project predicts whether a website is **safe or potentially a phishing site** based on certain features and characteristics of the URL and website.
It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to **cybersecurity tasks** in a practical and beginner-friendly way.

The workflow includes **data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training**, all clearly documented in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Note About the Notebook

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section due to updates in Python and Jupyter. The results, logic, and overall functionality remain completely identical to the original video.**
