# **Project 39: Watermark Image Classifier**

This project demonstrates how to **add custom watermarks to images** using Python.
Users can overlay **text or logo-based watermarks** onto any image while maintaining proper positioning and scaling.

**It combines creativity with image-processing logic, showing how Python can be used to manipulate images dynamically and accurately.**

This project is a fun and practical example of **image manipulation without machine learning**.

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

Place the following files in the **same directory**:

* **app.py**
* **Logo.png**
* **Image.png**

Open a terminal in that directory and run:

* **streamlit run app.py**

A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to apply and preview watermarks on images interactively.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**No changes were made to the notebook. The image processing logic and watermark placement mechanism remain unchanged.**
