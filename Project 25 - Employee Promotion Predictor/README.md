# **Project 25: Employee Promotion Predictor**

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to be **promoted or not** based on factors such as performance metrics, experience, training scores, age, tenure, and other organizational attributes.

**It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to HR analytics to support data-driven promotion decisions and workforce planning.**

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**
   * **Scaler_y.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to input employee details and predict promotion outcomes interactively.
