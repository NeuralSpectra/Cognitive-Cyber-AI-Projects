# Project 12: Customer Segmentation Predictor

This project segments customers into meaningful groups using demographic and behavioral features such as **age, income, spending score, profession, work experience, and more.**

It demonstrates how machine learning (typically clustering techniques) can be applied to understand customer behavior and create business-driven segmentation models.

## How to Use the Streamlit Application

1. Make sure **Python 3.8+** is installed and you have an IDE like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

**streamlit run app.py**

4. Interact with the customer input fields to see the predicted segment/group.

## Note About the Notebook

**Minor adjustments were made in the Model Building section to accommodate updates in Python and Jupyter. All results, logic, and the prediction workflow remain fully consistent with the original reference implementation.**
