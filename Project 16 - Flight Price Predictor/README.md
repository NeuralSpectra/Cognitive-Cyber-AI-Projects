# **Project 16: Flight Price Predictor**

This project predicts flight prices based on features such as **Route, Destination, Source, Arrival Minute, Departure Time, Stops, and Duration**, among others.  

**It demonstrates how machine learning can analyze flight data to estimate prices and helps travelers, analysts, and researchers understand key factors affecting airfare.**

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. Place the following files in the **same directory**:

   * **app.py**
   * **Finalized-Model.pickle**
   * **Scaler_X.pickle**
   * **Scaler_y.pickle**
   * **Route_LE.pickle**

3. Open a terminal in that directory and run:

    **streamlit run app.py**

4. A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to interact with the app and predict flight prices live.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some minor changes were made in the Model Building section to account for updates in Python, Jupyter, and library versions. The results, logic, and model performance remain completely identical to the original analysis.**
