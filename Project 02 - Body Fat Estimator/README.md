# **Project 2: Body Fat Estimator**

### **Project Description**

In this project, I created a model that estimates **body fat percentage** using **5 different features** — **Density, Abdomen, Chest, Hip, and Weight**.
You just have to enter these values, and the model will predict your **body fat percentage**.

This is a **machine learning regression problem**, where I built and trained a precise model to provide accurate predictions.
You can also interact with the model using the **Streamlit web application** for a live, user-friendly experience.

### **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

1. Make sure you have **VS Code** or **PyCharm** installed with **Python 3.8 or above**.
2. Download or clone the following files into the **same directory**:

   * app.py
   * Finalized-Model.pickle
   * Scaler_X.pickle
   * Scaler_y.pickle

3. Open a terminal in your editor and run:

   **streamlit run app.py**

4. This will automatically open a new browser tab where you can use the interactive GUI of the model.

### **Note About the Notebook**

Some minor changes were made in the **Jupyter Notebook (Model Building section)** due to updates in Python and Jupyter.
The results and functionality remain **completely identical** to the original video.
