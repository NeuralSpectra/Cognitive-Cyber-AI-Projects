# **Project 33: Car Acceptability Predictor**

This project predicts the **acceptability of a car** based on multiple attributes and classifies it into one of the following categories:
**unacc, acc, good, vgood**.

It demonstrates how a **classification model** can assist users in evaluating and comparing car options using data-driven insights.

## **How to Use the Streamlit Application**

Ensure **Python 3.8+** is installed on your system with an editor like **VS Code** or **PyCharm**.

Place the following files in the same directory:

* **app.py**
* **Finalized-Model.pickle**
* **Scaler_X.pickle**

Open a terminal in that directory and run:

* **streamlit run app.py**

A browser tab will open automatically, allowing you to input car features and view the predicted acceptability class.

## **Note About the Notebook**

**Some minor changes were made due to updates in Python and library versions. The core classification logic, feature processing, and model behavior remain unchanged**.
